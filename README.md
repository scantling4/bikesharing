# Bike-sharing Proposal

## Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis was to utilize bike-sharing data from New York City to create a business proposal for a bike-sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa and to assess the likelihood of success. Tablaeu was then utlized to create visualizations for the proposal of the business. We decided to hone in on the month of August. An important factor that was analyzed was the tripduration. This variable led to insights on how long each bike was rented for, when they were rented and popular times in which they were rented. Before visualizations could be created, the tripduration data type had to be changed to datetime which was done in Jupyter Notebook. The updated csv file was then uploaded to Tablaeu. 
  
 ## Results 
 Seven different visualizations were selected to create a story of what the bike-sharing data reveals. These visualization include the following: 
 - Number of Rides in the Month of August 
 
         :there was a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August
 - A pie chart showing the ratio of customers versus subscribers (usertype)
 
        :from the total trips taken in August, 1,900,359 users were subscribers, and 443,865 were customers. 
 - A line graph of the total amount of trips by the day of week
 
        :Thursday is shown to be the day of the week that most bikes are riden
 - A line graph of the checkout time for users 
 
        :The peak times for length of time bikes are checked out is 5-6 hours 
 - A heatmap of the trips per weekday for each hour of the day
 
        :The peak day and time in August is Thursday between 5-7 p.m.
 - A line graph of the checkout times for users filtered by gender
 
        :Males ride bikes significantly more often than females
 - A heatmap of the number of trips per gender: broken down by weekday and hour
 
        :Peak hours to not vary by gender
 - A heatmap of the number of trips based on gender and usertype: broken down by weekday 
 
        :Looking across two separate metrics: usertype and gender, the highest reported bike rides are shown to occur on Thursdays.

 ## Summary 
 After looking at various visulaizations- and is demonstrated in the storyboard that was created- the most popular day to ride a bike is on Thursday. Both the visualizations and data support the creation of a bike-sharing business in Des Moines. It may be recommended to have a trial period in Des Moines- as it is a different city and will have different factors that will affect bike usage- before fully investing. This will also reassure investors that they are making the correct decision. Because we only looked at the month of August for this analysis, a visualization of the colder months, such as December, would be of interest to investors. Another visualization that would be beneficial would be to look at the birthdate of the riders and see if there are ay trends there. If there are, marketing towards a certain group of people may be advantageous for this new company.

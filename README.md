# Bike-sharing Proposal

## Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis was to utilize bike-sharing data from New York City to create a business proposal for a bike-sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa and to assess the likelihood of success. Tablaeu was then utlized to create visualizations for the proposal of the business. We decided to hone in on the month of August. An important factor that was analyzed was the tripduration. This variable led to insights on how long each bike was rented for, when they were rented and popular times in which they were rented. Before visualizations could be created, the tripduration data type had to be changed to datetime which was done in Jupyter Notebook. The updated csv file was then uploaded to Tablaeu. 
  
 ## Results 
 Seven different visualizations were selected to create a story of what the bike-sharing data reveals. These visualization include the following: 
 - Number of Rides in the Month of August 
 - A pie chart showing the ratio of customers versus subscribers (usertype)
 - A line graph of the total amount of trips by the day of week
 - A line graph of the checkout time for users 
 - A heatmap of the trips per weekday for each hour of the day
 - A line graph of the checkout times for users filtered by gender
 - A heatmap of the number of trips per gender: broken down by weekday and hour
 - A heatmap of the number of trips based on gender and usertype: broken down by weekday
